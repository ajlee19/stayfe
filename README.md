# STAYFE

Created a unique method of crime data crawling from public news media sources versus standard police report data, and used natural language processing libraries along with machine learning methods sto classify whether a sentence in an article has crime data. Transformed those data into coordinates and mapped onto interactive maps, and eventually onto creating a safety-prevention web app or a mobile app.
